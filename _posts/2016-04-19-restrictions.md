Stage Flavour does not offer budget or travel expenses.  
For international artists we'll try to find accommodation when necessary, but cannot guarantee this for everyone.  
The venue provides the possibility to make use of: a space, sound amplification, a microphone, a few stage lights, a video projector.  
Stage Flavour is run by artists and only offers a milieu with a minimum of technical possibilities. Artists are expected to do their own light and sound, or come with a person to help them.
